# Debugging in Programming - README

## Project Overview

This file contains a project which aims to demonstrate debugging in programming. Debugging is a critical skill for software developers to identify and fix issues in their code effectively. 
This project provides valuable resources, and tasks to help developers improve their debugging skills.
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly.
As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
What is debugging
What are some methods of debugging manually
How to read the error messages
